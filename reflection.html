    	<h2>Welcome to the Museum of Toilet Paper Alternatives</h2>
     
    	
    <p style="color: #ffffd9; font-weight: 600;">Hi there! Nowadays, toilet paper has been threatened with extinction, so I decided to create this web page to show toilet paper alternatives from different historical periods.</p>

	<p>Responsive Design - means designing a site with certain property values. For example, a flexible layout grid that allows one layout to work on different devices. Doing this assessment I got that the philosophy of responsive web design is that the site was convenient for viewing from any device, regardless of screen size.Also, I figured out the main feature of responsive web design - thanks to the fluid mesh, the layout automatically responds to screen resizing, swelling or tapering like a balloon.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>Internet users browse sites of various sizes. Therefore, it is important that the site is adapted to any of them. There are two main approaches to creating sites that are easily adaptable to various types of devices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Responsive Design</li>
			<li>Adaptive Design</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In this work, I tried to unleash the potential of responsive design.</p>
</li>


<li>
	<p> Making my website I used different next to make my design responsive :</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>To make text content flexible, I used relative units instead of fixed ones. For example, for a fixed font-size: 30px, the relative size is 30px / 16px = 1.875em.</li>

		<li>In order to solve the problem of flexible images, I used the rule for all images .pics{ max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;}.This rule ensures that images will never be wider than their containers and will never exceed their true size on large screens.</li>

		<li>To achieve layout flexibility, I used relative units of measurement instead of fixed pixel values, which allows me to adjust the width to fit the available space. For example, width: 47%; I used for div blocks.</li>

		<li>I also used card interfaces - rectangular shapes with rounded corners, which are containers for content. Such blocks are self-contained units of the interface and are easy to move around the layout.
	    </li>
	 
	 </ul>
</li>

<li>
	<p>Overall I figured out that building web apps for different devices is not that hard how it looks like. You just should follow special techniques to make your web page friendliness. For example, the responsive design combines three techniques - a flexible layout based on the grid, flexible images and media queries. Media queries change styles based on device characteristics related to displaying content, including type, width, height, orientation, and screen resolution. Using media queries, responsive design is created in which appropriate styles are applied to each screen size.</p>
